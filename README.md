ðŸ›’ Beelion: a smart Grocery List App
</h1>

## [Beelion RedwoodJS][blrw]

Have you ever forgotten something you needed from the grocery store? Have you ever forgotten something else?

You wasted two trips to the store so you could make that Penne al Vodka.

Well that happened to use...several times. So I made a [grocery list app][beelion] called Bee Lion.

## Origin

It was originally built with [MeteorJS][meteor] back in 2015. I've lost the RSA codes to the server and I don't think I can even get into it. Plus...

I wanted to build it on a more modern stack.

I chose [RedwoodJS][redwood], a framework "bringing full-stack to the Jamstack".

I also [streamed][ytstream] the making of this.

## Getting Started

We use Yarn as the packet manager.

```
git clone https://github.com/csellis/grocery.git
cd grocery
yarn install
yarn redwood dev
```
